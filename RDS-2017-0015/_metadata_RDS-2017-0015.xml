    <descript>
      <abstract>The data included in this publication include visitor characteristics, attitudes towards the wilderness experience, and use patterns for wilderness visitors to the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex (BMWC) in 1982. Visitors were asked to provide contact information for a mail-back survey. Questions included that of age, education, types of groups, club memberships, attitudes such as satisfaction with wilderness experience, as well as use pattern questions such as method of travel, length of stay, and activities engaged in during trip. Over 700 responses were obtained. In part, the data were collected to replicate a 1970 study in the same area. The format of the surveys and data was informed by the earlier study for later trend anaylsis</abstract>
      <purpose>The study of visitors to the BMWC was conducted to inform planning and management for outdoor recreational use in the BMWC. This study also partly replicated a study done in the same area in 1970, which allowed for the development of trends in the visitor characteristics, attitudes, and use patterns.</purpose>

      <descgeog>The BMWC consists of three contiguous National Forest Wildernesses—the Bob Marshall, the Great Bear, and the Scapegoat—on both sides of the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains south of Glacier National Park. The Bob Marshall contains 1,009,000 acres (408,000 hectares [ha]), the Great Bear 287,000 acres (116,000 ha), and the Scapegoat 239,000 acres (97,000 ha), for a total in the complex of a little over 1.5 million acres (over 600,000 ha), or over 6 percent of all the wilderness acres in the National Forests at the time of the study. The BMWC is located in northwest Montana, just south of Glacier National Park. Nearby cities include Kalispell, Whitefish, and Missoula.</descgeog>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>In some cases, a single variable may have multiple code descriptions which seem to be the same. These descriptions were taken from the original codebook, and it is unclear if there was a difference in meaning originally.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>For most no/yes questions, response code '1' is 'No' and '2' is 'Yes,' but this is not true for all cases. Please pay attention to the response codes as noted per variable in the Entity and Attributes section below.
	
There are a few cases where a set of variables appear to be very similar to another set of variables. We left the data as originally entered. As an example: CMPCOD-OTHLOCN at the end of the data file are just a different (less compact) way of coding the original REJCOND-RESLOC. We believe CMPCOD-OTHLOCN were re-coded in 1988, after the fact, but we do not know specifically why.</logic>
    <complete>In some cases unchecked boxes on the survey were counted as 'no' responses, and in others they were considered 'missing.'  Generally 'missing' codes seem to have been used when none of the boxes were checked for a question, whereas if some boxes were checked, the remaining unchecked boxes were considered to be 'No's. This may not always be the case.

Several variables represent free text responses on the survey (i.e. "other"  descriptions or "comments"), however the corresponding text/codes in many cases have been lost. If the code is not included in the variable description, it is because that data has been lost.

Note that typically a blank means not applicable, and a specific code (noted under variable descriptions) is used for missing. There may be some cases where this is not the case. The data are provided as originally entered and any information we have has been included.</complete>

      <method>
        <methtype>Field</methtype>
        <methdesc>SOURCE OF SAMPLES:

The study population was all adult visitors (defined as anyone 16 years old or older) entering the three areas in summer and fall. The basic method was personal contact of visitors, supplemented by temporary special registration stations.

Three field workers in 1982 contacted all visitors entering or leaving at 34 trailheads on selected sample dates. (Sampling procedures are described below.) They briefly explained the study, and asked visitors 16 and older to voluntarily to provide their names and addresses so that some of them could be selected for a mail-back questionnaire about their trip and their ideas concerning wilderness. Managers estimate that personal contact at all trailheads was an average of at least five visitors per week. There was only one refusal in 1982.

Special portable trail registers were used in 1982 at 14 trailheads estimated to average at least one but less than five visitors per week. 

These special trail registers explained that a study was in progress, asked visitors at least 16 years old to register as individuals (not just the group leader), and provide full mailing addessses. Cooperation was excellent. Field checking in 1970 indicated registration rates of 94 percent for hikers and 67 percent for visitors with horses. Informal observation in 1982 suggested similar high registration rates.

In both study years, visitors who entered at trailheads were included whether they crossed a wilderness boundary or not. Most sampled visitors entered one of the three wildernesses in 1982.


MAIL-BACK QUESTIONNAIRE PROCEDURES: 

Names and addresses of selected visitors were entered in two lists. One list was in questionnaire serial number order. It was used to log in returned questionnaires and to prepare followup mailings. In 1982, following procedures suggested by Dillman (1978), nonrespondents were sent a reminder postcard after 3 weeks, and, if no response was received, another questionnaire and cover letter were mailed 3 weeks later. 

The other list of names and addresses was in alphabetical order to avoid sampling the same person repeatedly and unduly imposing on their cooperation. Less than 1 percent of the sampled persons were selected twice. They received a weight of 2. No one was selected more than twice.


SAMPLE DESIGN: 

The main sample design was a cluster sample, with paired selection of primary samples from unequal-sized clusters, with the clusters chosen with probabilities proportional to size (PPS) and subsampled with probabilities inversely proportional to size (Kish 1967, chapter 7). The PPS concept used estimates of average weekly use by the managers of each area as measures of "size." For example, imagine two trailheads, one (A) estimated to have 100 people entering per week, the other (B) estimated to have 10 per week. Trail A is 10 times as likely as B to be sampled (to receive direct trailhead checking). This sampling method means important major trails are almost sure to be sampled and guards against much time being wasted to produce few sample visitors; but it does not give every visitor an equal chance to be sampled. To achieve that, the persons whose names and addresses were obtained in each cluster at the different trailheads were then subsampled with probabilities inversely proportional to size. In the example, this means that persons on the list at A have only one-tenth the chance of being subsampled as persons at B. The probabilities proportional to size cancel out, and everyone has the same chance of being chosen in the final sample. In other words, a visitor at A is 10 times as likely as a visitor at B to have his or her name requested, but a visitor who gives his or her name at B is 10 times as likely to be mailed a questionnaire.

One reason for this seemingly roundabout procedure was to try to produce final clusters of about the same size. Equal, or at least reasonably close, cluster sizes are important to produce an efficient sample that will yield precise, unbiased estimates, given the size of the sample (Kish 1967). In the example, if one-half of the trail B people were sampled and one-twentieth of the trail A people, each cluster would consist of five people if use was what it was estimated to be. Variation between actual use for a sample time period compared to the estimated use introduces unavoidable variations in cluster size, of course.

Trails were chosen from summer and fall strata. In 1982 there were 74 clusters, based on 4-day weekday periods (Monday through Thursday) and 3-day weekends (Friday through Sunday), with a planned size of 10 people each.

In 1982 the special registration signs at lightly used trailheads for the supplemental sample were in place continuously, resulting in a greater chance for these visitors to become involved in the survey than those contacted in person. Half of these registrants were sampled and, to avoid overrepresenting them, their responses were weighted down to provide equal representation with the basic cluster sample.</methdesc>

This data publication contains the following comma-delimited ASCII text file containing the results of the mail-back survey. ** PLEASE REVIEW THE COMMENTS ON ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS ABOVE to ensure that you understand some of the nuances of these data. The numbers in parentheses at the beginning of variable descriptions are the corresponding question number in the survey: \Supplements\BMWC_1982_Survey.pdf.

*NOTE: There are a few questions that allow multiple responses (e.g. SHOT1, SHOT2, SHOT3 and TRLINF1, TRLINF2, TRLINF3). If there was a survey response provided only for the first and/or second (meaning they did not provide a response to all parts of the question), then the remaining responses were recorded as 0. These 0's are not specifically defined below. Unfortunately there are a few cases where the responses were not coded like this, but that is the exception and not the norm, and we are not sure why they were coded in this alternate manner.
